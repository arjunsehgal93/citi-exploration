# citi-exploration
An exploration and initial trends into the CitiBike Data for time periods in 2014 and 2015.

This is the first part on a multi-part project I have planned. The overall aim is to compare trends amongst NYC Yellow Taxi, CitiBike and Uber rides in New York City. 
The data for all the above is available freely over the internet and can be found at the following links:
  1. CitiBike Trip Data: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html
  2. NYC Yellow Taxi Data: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
  3. Uber Data: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response
  
We have vast data availbale for CitiBike & NYC Yellow Taxi. But the limiting factor here is the availabliity of Uber data. The data for Uber is only available for April 2014 to September 2014 and Jan 2015 to July 2015. 

Thus, as the ultimate aim is to compare all the three, I have limited the data for CitiBike and Yellow Taxi to the same period as that of Uber. 

This first project has a Jupyter Notebook in which I have explored CitiBike Data for these two time periods. I have made use of python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn in order to process the data and visualise trends within it.

The documentation for these libraries is available at:
  1. Pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/
  2. Numpy: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/
  3. Matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html
  4. Seaborn: https://seaborn.pydata.org/
